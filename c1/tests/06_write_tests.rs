/// properties:
/// - After sanitization, the result must not end with the character `x`
/// - After sanitization, the result must not end with the character `o`
/// - After sanitization, the result must not end with the string `.exe`
///
/// The function assumes that the input to the function only consists of lower and uppercase
/// characters from the English alphabet and digits 0-9.
///
/// The implementation contains some bugs.
///
/// Your task is to write a set (at least 8) of unit tests, use them to find (at least 2) bugs in
/// this function and then fix the function.
